**Consider the following cases/scenario, and give a numeric estimation of the risk associate to each one. Note that you might take some assumptions in order to determine the parameter of the risk assessment. Try to make such assumptions realistic and justifiable.**

**(a) UAB information systems: suppose we have an specific DB to store the student marks,
and we want to estimate the risk associated to having one student changing its mark. To do that we consider that the only option to do it is by performing a XSS attack in the information system front end.**

$$
T = 1;  V =  
$$
$$
	R =  
$$
**(b) UAB information systems: the university has an specific server to run the application to
manage access to parking and buildings for personnel. Such server is only connected to the UAB network and cannot be accesses from the Internet (not even through the UAB VPN). We consider the possibility for such server to suffer a denial of service (DoS) attack with a whole day duration.**
